Hello! My name is Krisanat Anukarnsakulchularp, or you can call me Otto. My sister drew my profile picture inspired by my favorite animal.

I'm currently working as a Teaching associate at Monash University for the Econometrics and Business Statistics department. My interests are in data structure and visualization.
